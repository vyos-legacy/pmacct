  * * Refreshed building system * Rolled version counters
  * * nfacctd, sfacctd: aggregate_filter can now filter against TCP
    flags
  * * pmacct client: numeric variables output converted to unsigned from
    signed * nfacctd_net, sfacctd_net: default value changed from null
    (and related error message) to 'netflow' for nfacctd_net and 'sflow'
    for sfacctd_net.
  * * MySQL, SQLite3 plugins: sql table version 8 issued to provide
    common naming convention when mapping primitives to database fields
    among the supported RDBMS base. Thanks to Chris Wilson for his
    support.
  * * sfacctd: interface format merged back into interface value fields
    so to ease keeping track of discards (and discard reasons) and
    multicast fanout * nfacctd: fixed typo preventing the package to
    compile when enabling IPv6; only version affected by the issue is
    0.12.5-cvs.
  * * nfprobe: introducing egress IPv4/IPv6 NetFlow v9 templates * fixed
    naming convention for some mispelled examples documentation. Thanks
    to Xavier Vitard for having spotted the issue.

    on direction field
  * * [ns]facctd_net: directive can now be specified per-plugin;
    documentation updated.
  * * fix, util.c: string copies in trim_spaces(), trim_all_spaces() and
    strip_quotes() have been rewritten more safely. Patch is courtesy of
    Dmitry Koplovich.
  * * nfacctd: introduced support for application classification via
    NetFlow v9 field type #95 (application ID) and application name
    table option. This mechanism aligns with Cisco NBAR-NetFlow v9
    integration feature.

    primitives (VLAN, MAC addresses) when performing egress
    measurements.
  * * nfacctd: introduced support for NAT L3/L4 field values via
    xlate_src and xlate_dst configuration directives. Implementation
    follows IPFIX standard for IPv4 and IPv6 (field types 225, 226, 227,
    228, 281 and 282) and is added by a compatibility glue to support
    Cisco ASA NetFlow v9 NSEL field types 40001, 40002, 40003, 40004. *
    nfacctd: added support for IPFIX/Cisco ASA NetFlow v9 NSEL msecs
    absolute timestamps: field types 152, 153 and 323.
  * * nfacctd: introduced support for 'new' TCP/UDP source/destination
    ports (field types 180, 181, 182, 183), as per IPFIX standard,
    basing on the L4 protocol value (if any, otherwise assume L4 is not
    TCP/UDP). * nfacctd: introduced support for egress bytes and packet
    counters (field types 23, 24) basing on the direction value (if any,
    otherwise assume ingress as per RFC3954).
  * * BGP daemon: introduced support for IPv6 transport of BGP messaging
    * bgp_agent_map has been improved to allow mapping of NetFlow/sFlow
    agents making use of IPv6 transport to either a) IPv4 transport
    address of BGP sessions or b) 32-bit BGP Router IDs * documentation
    and examples updated
  * * fix, sql_common.c: increased buffer size available for
    sql_table_schema from 1KB to 8KB.

    object for a given NetFlow agent. Only affected version is 0.12.5-
    cvs. * fix, nfacctd, sfacctd: daemons were crashing on OpenBSD
    platform upon setting an aggregate_filter configuration directive.
    Patch is courtesy of Manuel Pata.

  * * peer_src_ip (IP address/agent ID of the device exporting
    NetFlow/sFlow datagrams) and peer_dst_ip (BGP next-hop) can now be
    filled from NetFlow/ sFlow protocols data. To activate,
    nfacctd_as_new/sfacctd_as_new have to be 'false' (default value),
    'true' or 'file'.
  * * BGP daemon: new bgp_daemon_ipprec feature allows to mark self-
    originated BGP messages with the supplied IP precedence value.
  * * BGP daemon, bgp_daemon_ipprec: SOL_IP moved to IPPROTO_IP for
    better portability. Added detection for failure setting IP_TOS
    socket option.
  * * nfprobe, sfprobe: introduced support for export of the BGP next-
    hop information. Source data selection for BGP next-hop is being
    linked to [pmacctd_as|uacctd_as] configuration directive. Hence it
    must be set to 'bgp' in order for this feature to work.
  * * Enhanced 802.1ad pmacctd support. While recursing, outer VLAN is
    always reported as value of the 'vlan' primitive. * Fix, pmacctd:
    802.1p was kept integral part of the 'vlan' primitive. Now a 0x0FFF
    mask is applied in order to return only the VLAN ID.
  * * Documentation updated * pgsql_plugin.c, PG_create_dyn_table():
    PGRES_TUPLES_OK is now considered valid return code in case a SELECT
    statement is involved (ie. as part of a PL/PGSQL function). Thanks
    very much to Sergio Charpinel Jr for his support.
  * * Building sub-system and directory structure preparations for an
    upcoming new tee plugin
  * * fix, ip_frag.c: orphan fragment log messages re-classified as
    debug. * fix, pkt_handlers.c: added explicit trailing '\0' symbol
    when truncating AS-PATH and BGP community strings due to length
    constraints.
  * * Inauguration of tee_plugin()
  * * tee_plugin: sFlow and NetFlow replication implementation is
    underway; tee_receiver, tee_source_ip and tee_transparent features
    being developed.
  * * tee_plugin: sFlow and NetFlow replication implementation is
    underway; transparent IPv4/IPv6 replication feature added.
  * * tee_plugin: implementation wrapped-up. Documentation underway.
  * * fix, sql_common.c: maximum SQL writers warning message was never
    reached unless a recovery method is specifited. Thanks to Sergio
    Charpinel Jr for reporting the issue. * Documentation
  * * nfprobe, sfprobe: nfprobe_ipprec and sfprobe_ipprec features
    introduced to mark self-originated NetFlow and sFlow datagrams with
    the supplied IP precedence value. * nfprobe: removed unused routines
    and sanitized logging a bit.
  * * nfacctd: NetFlow v9, options parsing polish up.
  * * tee_plugin, fix: internal data structure better 64-bit aligned.
  * * print_plugin: implemented CSV (comma-separated values) output
    format, alongside existing tabular one. Introduced a print_output
    configuration directive to select among available output formats.
  * * MySQL, MY_create_dyn_table(): errno 1050 (ER_TABLE_EXISTS_ERROR)
    is being considered valid condition. * Documentation
  * * Rolled version counters.
  * * New 'cos' aggregation primitive has been implemented providing
    support for 802.1p priority bits. Collection is supported via sFlow,
    libpcap and ULOG; export is supported via sFlow. * sfprobe: partial
    Switch Extension Header support added. * fix, addr.c: pm_ntohll()
    and pm_htonll() routines rewritten. These are aimed to change byte
    ordering of 64-bit variables. Successfully tested against NetFlow
    64-bit bytes/packet counters.
  * * nfacctd: maximum NetFlow v9 type lifted to 256. * nfprobe,
    sfprobe: send buffer size is now aligned to plugin_pipe_size if any
    is specified providing a way to tune it in case of sustained
    exports.
  * * BGP daemon: TCP MD5 signature implemented. A new
    'bgp_daemon_md5_file' configuration directive is added for the
    purpose of defining BGP peers and their respective MD5 keys, one per
    line, in CSV format.
  * * bgp_daemon_md5_file: map made reloadable at runtime. Existing MD5
    keys are removed via setsockopt(), new ones are installed as per the
    newly supplied map. * bgp_daemon_md5_file: added sample map,
    'examples/bgp_md5.lst.example'.
  * * BGP daemon: added support for RFC3107, ie. SAFI=4 label
    information, to enable receipt of labeled IPv4/IPv6 unicast
    prefixes. * Documentation updates
  * * fix, BGP daemon: support for IPv6 global address + link-local
    address next-hops as part of MP_REACH_NLRI parsing * Updated
    documentation
  * * nfacctd: added support for debugging of NetFlow v9 templates
  * * fix, nfacctd: when accounting for IPv6 traffic, wrong network mask
    fields were grabbed. Field types 29 and 30 are correctly fetched
    now.
  * * fix, pmacct.c: in_iface, out_iface aggregation primitives
    erroneusly kept within a "#if defined (HAVE_L2)" code section when
    parsing '-c' option.
  * * fix, nfacctd: NetFlow v9 template print out for unknown field
    types
  * * cfg_handlers.c: bgp_daemon, bgp_daemon_msglog parsing fixed. * SQL
    documentation fixes.
  * * nfprobe, sfprobe: introducing concept of traffic direction. As a
    result, [ns]fprobe_direction and [ns]fprobe_ifindex configuration
    directives have been implemented. * [ns]fprobe_direction defines
    traffic direction. Can be statically defined via 'in' and 'out'
    keywords. It can also be dynamically determined via lookup to either
    'tag' or 'tag2' values. * [ns]fprobe_ifindex statically associates
    an interface index (ifIndex) to a given nfprobe or sfprobe plugin. *
    sfprobe: sfprobe_ifspeed configuration directive is introduced and
    aimed at statically associating an interface speed to a given
    sfprobe plugin.
  * * [ns]fprobe_ifindex now supports semi-dynamic lookups against
    either 'tag' or 'tag2'. This is in addition to previously
    implemented static ifIndex support. Updated docs and examples.
  * * fix, sfprobe_plugin.c: counter sample showing wrong ifindex when
    in semi- dynamic mode.
  * * sfprobe: added support for multi-interface Counter Samples
  * * fix, bgp.c: CPU hog issue was caused by missing cleanup of the
    select() descriptors vector. * fix, nfprobe: nfprobe_ifindex value
    was incorrectly evaluated * fix, sfprobe: upon introducing support
    for multi-interfaces, the linked list of counter samples was found
    to get corrupted.
  * * fix, nfprobe: nfprobe_ifindex and nfprobe_direction were not
    working with tag/tag2 setup and NetFlow v5 export due to tags
    suppression. * fix, sfprobe: sampler process moved into the plugin
    in order to correctly populate counter samples.
  * * Documentation updated
  * * fix, sfprobe: Counter Samples index was uninitialized
  * * sfacctd: added support for egress VLAN and CoS (802.1p)

  * * Input/output interfaces (SNMP index) have been implemented
    natively; it's therefore not required anymore to pass through the
    tag infrastructure. As a result two aggregation primitives are being
    introduced: 'in_iface' and 'out_iface'. * Updated documentation.
    Also added sql/README.iface to describe usage of 'in_iface' and
    'out_iface' primitives; added sql/README.is_symmetric to describe
    usage of 'is_symmetric' primitive.
  * * Support for source/destination IP prefix masks is introduced via
    two new aggregation primitives: src_mask and dst_mask. These are
    populated as per the [nf|sf|pm|u]acctd_net directive: NetFlow/sFlow
    protocols, BGP, Network files (networks_file) or static
    (networks_mask) being valid data sources. * fix, nfacctd.h: source
    and destination netmasks were twisted within the NetFlow v5
    structure. Affected releases are: 0.12.0rc4 and 0.12.0. *
    Documentation updated.
  * * nfprobe: network masks are now exported via NetFlow v5/v9.
    'pmacctd_net' and its equivalents steer how to populate
    src_mask/dst_mask values. * cleanup, nfprobe/sfprobe: data source
    for src_as/dst_as primitives is now expected to be always
    explicitely defined. The only case affected is getting ASN values
    out of a Networks File: up to now, it was sufficient to define a
    networks_file to use it; now 'pmacctd_as: file' needs to be
    configured aswell.
  * * sfprobe: network masks are now exported via sFlow v5.
    'pmacctd_net' and its equivalents steer how to populate
    src_mask/dst_mask values.
  * * Initial implementation of tunnel inspection feature in pmacctd and
    uacctd daemons. Tunnel handlers might be feeded with options via
    configuration. Once enabled, the daemon will then account on
    tunnelled data rather than on the envelope. At this time only
    supported tunnel protocol is GTP, the GPRS tunnelling protocol
    (configured as: "tunnel_0: gtp, <UDP port>").
  * * Tunnel inspection generalized: internal structures will allow up
    to 8 tunnel stacks. Up to 4 tunnel layers per stack are already
    supported. First matching stack at the first layer, wins. * fix,
    nfprobe_plugin.c: l2_to_flowrec() was missing variable declaration
    if the package was configured for compilation with --disable-l2.
    Thanks to Brent Van Dussen for reporting the issue.
  * * uacctd: introduced MAC layer support the for Netlink/ULOG socket
  * * fix, bgp.c: bgp_attr_munge_as4path() return code was not defined
    for some cases. This was causing some BGP messages to be considered
    as malformed.
  * * sfprobe: if the MAC layer is not available, change header protocol
    to 11 (IPv4) or 12 (IPv6) from 1.
  * * Building sub-system: PF_RING workaround for pcap_dispatch not
    found
  * * Building sub-system: PF_RING workaround addendum
  * * ChangeLog updated * Documentation updated
  * * Documentation updated * Building sub-system: relax compiler

pmacct (0.12.1+vyatta+1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ paolo ]
  * * 'is_symmetric' primitive is being implemented: aimed to detect
    asymmetric traffic by basing on definitions included in a
    'bgp_is_symmetric_map' map file. * A few minor bugs related to
    bgp_src_med_map, bgp_src_local_pref_map and bgp_peer_src_as_map have
    been fixed. * Documentation updated.
  * * Updated documentation and examples * bgp/bgp.c:
    cache_to_pkt_bgp_primitives(), pkt_to_cache_bgp_primitives() have
    been fixed: is_symmetric primitive value was not correctly copied.
  * * Implementation of 'bgp_daemon_allow_file' to specify IP addresses
    that can establish a BGP session with the BGP thread * util.c:
    centralized daemons ACL set/check routines * Updated documentation
  * * fix, util.c: load_allow_file(), empty allow file was allowing
    every IP to connect - being confused with no map condition. Now this
    condition is properly recognized and translates in reject all. *
    fix, pmacct.c: is_symmetric printf formatting mistake corrected.
  * * fix, pkt_handlers.c: check added to impose a maximum size while
    copying NetFlow v9 fields to internal structures.
  * * nfacctd_ext_sampling_rate and sfacctd_ext_sampling_rate are
    introduced: flags the daemon that captured traffic is being sampled.
    Useful to tackle corner cases, ie. sampling rate reported by the
    NetFlow/sFlow agent is missing or not correct.
  * * fix, sql_common.c: logging of NetFlow micro-flows to a SQL
    database (nfacctd_sql_log directive) was not committing to the
    backend, when sql_history was disabled. This is now fixed.
  * * bgp_follow_nexthop: feature extended so that multiple IPv4/IPv6
    prefixes can be supplied. Up to 32 prefixes are now supported; a
    warning message is now generated if a supplied string fails parsing.
  * * Pre-Tagging: introduced 'comms' key to tag basing on up to 16
    standard BGP communities attached to the destination IP prefix. The
    lookup is done against the BGP RIB of the exporting router. Either
    match-any or match-all is available. Documentation and examples
    updated. * fix, pretag.c: bug introduced in CVS version only as part
    of 20091225 commit.
  * * Pre-Tagging: implemented src_local_pref and src_comms keys. These
    allow tagging on source IP prefix local_pref (sourced from either
    map or BGP, ie. 'bgp_src_local_pref_type: map',
    'bgp_src_local_pref_type: bgp') and standard BGP communities. * Pre-
    Tagging: src_peer_as key has been extended to match on BGP-sourced
    data (bgp_peer_src_as_type: bgp).
  * * fix, mysql|pgsql|sqlite_plugin.c: 'flows' aggregation primitive
    was not suitable to mix-and-match with BGP related primitives (ie.
    peer_dst_as, etc.) due to an incorrect check. Thanks to Zenon
    Mousmoulas for the bug report.
  * * fix, pretag_handlers.c: tagging against NetFlow v9 4-bytes
    input/output interfaces was not working properly. This is now fixed.
    Many thanks to Zenon Mousmoulas for reporting the issue.
  * * ChangeLog updated. * Version counter updated.
  * * Refreshed ChangeLog.
  * * 'nfprobe_source_ip' feature added: it allows to select the
    IPv4/IPv6 address to be used to export NetFlow datagrams to the
    collector.
  * * Rolled version counters
